OpenGL
======

The files here require the following packages to compile:

- community/glfw
- extra/glew
- aur/soil

As well as my [shader helper](https://github.com/fosskers/opengl-shaders)
code in an `ogls` directory, and my
[linear algebra helper](https://github.com/fosskers/opengl-linalg) in
an `ogll` directory.
